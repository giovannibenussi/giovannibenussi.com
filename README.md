Hi! I'm [Giovanni Benussi](https://twitter.com/giovannibenussi) and this is the repository for my personal blog that you can see at https://www.giovannibenussi.com/.

This is a Next.js project that reads MDX files to generate blog entries dynamically.

# Installation

To install this repository locally, you just need to install the dependencies and then run the `dev` script:

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Now you can go to http://localhost:3002/ to see the site.
