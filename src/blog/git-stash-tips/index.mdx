## Show Stash Diff

To see the difference between the current code and some stash's entry, you can run the following:

```bash
git stash show -p
```

You can specify a stash index too:

```bash
// git stash list
stash@{0}: First entry
stash@{1}: Second entry
stash@{2}: Third entry
stash@{3}: Fourth entry
stash@{4}: Fifth entry

git stash show -p 1 // Shows diff for stash@{1} // Second entry
```

## git stash push

You can run this command to save code into the stash with a specific message so
it's easier to differentiate multiple stash entries later (and even apply a
specific one by using [`git stash apply`](#git-stash-apply)):

```bash
git stash push -m "Custom Message"
```

_Note: `git stash save "Custom Message"` [is deprecated](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash#Documentation/git-stash.txt-push-p--patch-S--staged-k--no-keep-index-u--include-untracked-a--all-q--quiet-m--messageltmessagegt--pathspec-from-fileltfilegt--pathspec-file-nul--ltpathspecgt82308203), so I'd suggest to stick with `git stash push`._

## git stash apply

Let's suppose that you have the following entries in the stash:

```bash
// git stash list
stash@{0}: First entry
stash@{1}: Second entry
stash@{2}: Third entry
stash@{3}: Fourth entry
stash@{4}: Fifth entry
```

You can run `git stash apply` with the index of the stash list as a parameter (starting with 0) to apply the entry "Third entry" from the stash:

```bash
git stash apply 2
```

This means that `git stash pop` is equivalent to `git stash apply 0`.

## Apply a Stash Without Removing it From the List

If you may want to apply some changes but keep them in the stash, you can run
the following:

```bash
git stash apply
```

According to [`git`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash#Documentation/git-stash.txt-apply--index-q--quietltstashgt) docs:

> Like pop, but do not remove the state from the stash list

## Disable Pagination for git stash list

There's [an issue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4226181/2043736) that prevents to add a global configuration to disable pagination for `git stash list`, so you can only do this on a per command basis:

```bash
git --no-pager stash list
```

This maybe be a bit cumbersome to repeat, so you can always create an alias for git stash list as I did:

```
alias gstl='git --no-pager stash list'
```

Now you can run `gstl` to list your stash entries.

## Stash a Specific File

If you want to stash a specific file(s), you can append them on the `git stash -m message` syntax:

```bash
git stash push -m "Custom Message" index.js package.json yarn.lock
```
