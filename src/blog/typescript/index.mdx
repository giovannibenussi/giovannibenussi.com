TypeScript [provides some handy methods](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#returntypetype) to facilitate type transformations. One of them is `ReturnType`, which allows us to get the return type of a function, which can be useful to avoid hardcoding types in your code that can break at any moment.

Continue reading to learn how to use the `ReturnType` function.

# TLDR

Use the `ReturnType` utility:

```ts
function sayHi(name: string) {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`
}

sayHi('Giovanni') // Hi, Giovanni!
type SayHiReturnType = ReturnType<typeof sayHi> // string
```


# Get the Return Type of a Function in Typescript

Let's start with a simple function that returns a string:

```ts
function sayHi(name: string) {
  return `Hi, ${name}!`
}

sayHi('Giovanni') // Hi, Giovanni!
```

To get the return type of the `sayHi` function, we could use the `ReturnType` utility provided globally by TypeScript:

```ts
type SayHiReturnType = ReturnType<typeof sayHi>
```

`SayHiReturnType` value will be the `string` type.

# Get the Return Type of an Async Function in Typescript

We need to update our code a bit to work with promises.


```ts
function sayHi(name: string) {
  return Promise.resolve(`Hi, ${name}!`);
}

type SayHiReturnType = ReturnType<typeof sayHi>
```

Now, `SayHiReturnType` is equal to `Promise<string>`, which may not be what we are expecting.

If we want to get the return type of our function, we need to use the [Awaited](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#awaitedtype) utility:

```ts
type SayHiReturnType = Awaited<ReturnType<typeof sayHi>>;
```

Now `SayHiReturnType` has a value of `string`.

# Conclusion

TypeScript has powerful yet simple utility functions like `ReturnType` that we can use to build resilient applications.

Start using them and you'll notice how you'll need to do less changes when updating something.
