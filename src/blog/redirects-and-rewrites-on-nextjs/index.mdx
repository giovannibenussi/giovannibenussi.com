URL changes very frequently, and sometimes you want to keep an old url working, or maybe you want to proxy a request. Next.js makes this task easy to accomplish without an additional proxy server like Nginx.

# Redirecting Requests
To [redirect requests in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects), you can set an `async` `redirects` function in your `next.config.js` file:

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/index',
        destination: '/',
        permanent: true,
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

In the previous example, any request to `/index` will be redirected to `/` permanently (with a 308 HTTP status).

If you want a temporary redirect, you can set `permanent: false` and the server will return a 307 HTTP status code.

You can add multiple entries to the return value of the `redirects` function to add multiple redirects.

# Proxying Requests
Your Next.js application can act as a proxy and handle requests while keeping the current url as opposed to redirects that change the url to the destination url.

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/about',
        destination: '/',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

In this case the user will see the url as `/about` but the content of the page will be the content of the `/` path.

You can redirect to other domains too:

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog',
        destination: 'https://giovannibenussi.com/',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

# Path Matching

If you want to keep the parameters in the url, you need to specify a patch matching variable as follows:

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
      source: '/blog/:author/:postID',
        destination: 'https://giovannibenussi.com/blog/:postID',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

With the rewrite defined above, a request to `/blog/giovannibenussi/1` will be redirected to `https://giovannibenussi.com/blog/1`.

If you want to catch all paths, you can use a wildcard path with `*`:

```js
// next.config.js

module.exports = {
  async rewrites() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/blog/:path*',
        destination: 'https://giovannibenussi.com/:path*',
      },
    ]
  },
}
```

With the rewrite defined above, a request to `/blog/hello/world/this/is/a/post` will be redirected to `https://giovannibenussi.com/hello/world/this/is/a/post` (notice that `/blog` is not included in the destination url because is not included in the catch all pattern).

# Conclusion

Next.js provides handy methods to redirect and proxy requests. Without this feature, we would need to setup a separate server like Nginx and handle the redirects ourselves, so this feature is very useful to keep everything in a single application.
