Here's a neat tip: if you want to take an screenshot of a DOM node, you can inspect the element by right clicking it and select *"Inspect"* as shown below:

![Inspecting a DOM element](./inspect-element.png)
<div className='text-center italic'>Inspecting an element from <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind's official website</a>.</div>

And then click *"Capture node screenshot"*:

![Select the capture node screenshot option](./capture-node-screenshot.png)

That's it! Your browser will download an screenshot of that DOM node to your
*Downloads* folder.
