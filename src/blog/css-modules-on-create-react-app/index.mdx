![CSS Modules in create-react-app](./css-modules-cra.png)
[CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) are great when building components because it allows you to create
locally scoped class names so you don't need to worry about naming conflicts. This is the
definition that
[the official CSS Modules repository](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) provides:

> A CSS Module is a CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

I'm not going to dig on the specific features of CSS Modules (maybe more of that
on another post!), but instead talk about how to use it on
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Let's add a new component called *Button.js*:

```js
// Button.js

import React from "react"

function Button() {
  return <button>Click me!</button>
}

export default Button
```

Now, create a file named *styles.module.css*:

```css
/* styles.module.css */

.myButton {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
}
```

**Note: it's important that your style file ends with the .module.css extension.
Otherwise, it's not going to be detected as a CSS module.**

To use our new styles we need to import out CSS Module file like this:

```js
// Button.js
import styles from './styles.module.css'
```

The `styles` variable is a simple object with a key for each class specified in
the CSS Module file:

```json
{
  myButton: "styles_myButton__3wuuo"
}
```

As you can see, our `myButton` class maps to a pseudo-random string
`"styles_myButton__3wuuo"`. This is cool because now we could do this:

```jsx
<button className={styles.myButton}>Click me!</button>
```

And it will be converted into this:

```jsx
<button className='styles_myButton__3wuuo'>Click me!</button>
```

*Note: `className` is used as the classic `class` attribute in plain HTML to
provide custom classes to elements.*

And that's it! It was easier than expected, wasn't it?

The process is as follows:

* Add a `.module.css` file
* Import the newly created file in your component
* Add a `className` attribute to your elements to reference some of the class
  names inside your CSS Module file.

As a last thing, the name `style.module.css` is not mandatory. You can use any
name as long as it ends with `.module.css`:

```jsx
// Button.js
import CustomName from './custom-name.module.css'

function Button() {
  return (
    <button className={CustomName.myButton}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  )
}
```

## Importing multiple classes
If you need to use multiple classes on an element, you can simply join their
class names:

```jsx
<button className={`${styles.myButton} ${styles.anotherClass}`}>
  Click me!
</button>
```

You can also use a library like
[classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) or
[clsx](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx):

```jsx
import clsx from 'clsx';

<button className={clsx(styles.myButton, styles.anotherClass)}>
  Click me!
</button>
```

# Last Words
As you were able to see, CSS Modules are very useful to style in an isolated way
our components on React. You have all the benefits of CSS without name
conflicts.
