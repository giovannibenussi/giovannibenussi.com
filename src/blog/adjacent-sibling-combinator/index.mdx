If you've been into web development for a bit, you know how fast it has been
evolving. CSS has gain a lot of features in the last years, allowing us to do
things that weren't possible before without Javascript. The adjacent sibling
combinator is k

## What's the Adjacent Sibling Combinator?

[According to MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator):

> The adjacent sibling combinator (+) separates two selectors and matches the second element only if it immediately follows the first element, and both are children of the same parent element.

Let's see an example of this:

```css
button {
  background-color: #3B82F6;
}

p + button {
  background-color: #10B981;
}
```

We are telling that if a button follows a paragraph, it should have a different
background color.

So, this markup:

```jsx
<button>First</button>
<button>Second</button>
<p>Paragraph content</p>
<button>Third</button>
<button>Fourth</button>
```

Will look like this:

<FirstExample />

As you can see, only the button that comes after the paragraph has a custom color.

## Generalizing our Solution
We can go a step further and apply a given style using the Adjacent sibling
combinator without it being specific to a given type.

Let's suppose we want to separate the following buttons between each other. We
might write down the following CSS:

```css
button {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

Here's how it will look:

<MarginExample />

As you can see there's extra margin above the first button.

We can solve this by using the Adjacent sibling combinator:

```css
button + button {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

<MarginExampleSolution />

This solves our current problem, but what happens if we want to apply the same
separation between elements for more than buttons? Or what if we want to apply
margins between different types of elements?

We can use the [CSS universal selector
(*)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) that
matches any element no matter its type to create a custom utility class to add
separation between elements:


```css
.separate-4 > * + * {
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

<MarginGenericSolution />

This selector is also known as the
[lobotomized owl selector](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/).

If needed, you can also combine different kind of selectors like `* + button`,
`button + *`, `.myClass + *`, `.myID + .myClass`. This allows to be very
flexible and match elements in such a way that wasn't possible in the past
without using Javascript.

## Conclusion
The adjacent sibling combinator is a very useful, yet not so well known
operator. It allows to create layouts without too much work and that is easy to
generalize.
