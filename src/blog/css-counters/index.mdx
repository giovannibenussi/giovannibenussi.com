[CSS custom
properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties), also known as CSS variables allow us to define custom properties, or variables to use in our CSS.

CSS counters are variables that you can use in your code. You can use counters to display things like heading and code block line numbers.

One real-world use case for counters is to [display line numbers in code blocks](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki/issues/3#issuecomment-830564854). The good think about this approach is that it doesn't require Javascript so you don't need to deal with internal logic to update styles.

## Our First Counter

Let's start with an example followed by a step-by-step explanation:

```css
.demo {
  counter-reset: paragraph-counter;
}

.demo p::before {
  counter-increment: paragraph-counter;
  content: "Paragraph " counter(paragraph-counter) ": ";
}
```

This counter displays "Paragraph x" before each paragraph. Let's try it out with
the HTML code from below.

```html
<p>First paragraph</p>
<p>Second paragraph</p>
<p>Third paragraph</p>
```

This produces the following output:

<CSSCounterNested />

Let's see what happens with nested paragraphs:

```html
<p>First paragraph</p>
<p>Second paragraph</p>
<div>
  <p>Nested paragraph</p>
</div>
<p>Third paragraph?</p>
```

<CSSCounterNested />

As you can see, it considers nested paragraphs too because our CSS rule
increments the count on every `p` tag. If you rather want to increment the
counter only on top level paragraphs, you'd need to increase the specifity of
your CSS by selecting only direct descendants of your parent element (changing
`.demo p` to `.demo > p`) as shown below:

```css
.demo {
  counter-reset: paragraph-counter;
}

.demo > p::before {
  counter-increment: paragraph-counter;
  content: "Paragraph " counter(paragraph-counter) ": ";
}
```

The change above produces the desired result:

<CSSCounterNestedFixed />

Now that you have a basic understanding, I'll detail and introduce CSS
properties to work with counters.

## counter-reset

We can specify an initial value to `counter-reset`:

```css
counter-reset: paragraph-counter 5;
```

<CSSCounterNestedFixed initialValue={5} />

Also works with negative numbers:

```css
counter-reset: paragraph-counter -5;
```

<CSSCounterNestedFixed initialValue={-5} />

You can reset multiple counters at the same time:

```css
counter-reset: paragraph-counter 5 another-counter 10;
```

## counter-increment

You can increment a counter by an arbitrary value:

```css
counter-increment: paragraph-counter 5;
```

If no value is specified, it will default to 1.

## counter-set

`counter-set` sets a counter to a given value.

```css
counter-set: paragraph-counter 5;
```

If you don't specify a value, it will default to 0:

```css
/* Set paragraph-counter to 0 */
counter-set: paragraph-counter;
```

## Conclusion

CSS counters allow to do things that were only possible with Javascript a few
years ago. I recommend you to take a look at places where you can start using counters!
