TLDR; Add the following function to get the size of your files:

```bash
duu() {
  local files="${1:-$(ls -A)}"
  du -hsc $files
}
```

The usage is as follows:

```bash
duu                  # All files (including hidden ones) in the current directory
duu *                # All visible files in the currrent directory
duu *.json           # All json files
duu directory/*.json # All json files in the `directory` folder
```

And that's it. If you want to understand what's going on, continue reading!

## The `du` command

I'm a big fan of using a shell for every task when working, and get the size for an item is not an exception.

[The du command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/du.1.html) estimates the space usage on disk for a set of files or directories. The `du` command without arguments lists the space usage of all files in the current directory and subdirectories.

You can specify a target like a folder or file as a parameter:

```bash
du file.txt
du directory
du directory/*.json
```

You can instruct `du` to output a human readable size format (using KB, M, and G) with the `-h` flag:

```bash
du -h *
# 1,0G    large.json
# 5,0M    medium.json
# 4,0K    small.json
```

By default, `du` will iterate over directories. You can avoid this behavior by passing the `-s` (summarize) flag. I strongly recommend to have this flag on always because if not, the command will be extremely slow on projects with a lot files on subdirectories (I'm looking at you _node_modules_!).

And lastly, you can add the `-c` (grand total) flag to get the total size of the files analyzed:

```bash
du -h *
# 1,0G    large.json
# 5,0M    medium.json
# 4,0K    small.json
# 1,0G    total # <- This is the sum of the analyzed files
```

## Creating a Bash Function
The flags listed in the previous section are my favorite ones, so I use them always. This results in the `du -hsc` command, which is a bit long and easy to make a mistake while typing it.

To avoid type this command always, you can create a function in your `.bashrc` file as follows:

```bash
duu() {
  local files="${1:-$(ls -A)}"
  du -hsc $files
}
```

The `local ...`  line assigns the `files` variable the first parameter provided to the command or sets it to `ls -A` otherwise (all files in the current directory, including hidden ones). We pass this value to the `du` command in the line below.

And that's it. You can copy this function whenever you want and simple run something like `du` to get the disk space of all files or `duu *.json` if you want to be more specific!
