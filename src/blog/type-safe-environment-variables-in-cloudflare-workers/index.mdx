TLDR; Define an `EnvType` type and set it to the `env` variable in your workers:

```ts
type EnvType = {
  API_VERSION: string;
};

export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: EnvType): Response {
    return new Response(`The version of the API is ${env.API_VERSION}`);
  },
};
```

Continue reading for a more detailed explanation.

## Adding Environment Variables

Let's start with the most basic handler for Workers with TypeScript:

```ts
export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: EnvType): Response {
    return new Response(`The version of the API is ${env.API_VERSION}`);
  },
};
```

We'll add an environment variable with the current API version to our `wrangler.toml` file:

```yaml
name = "workers-typescript-environment-variables"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2022-08-16"

[vars]
API_VERSION = "v2"
```

Restart the server and refresh.

As you can see, we set the `API_VERSION` environment variable to the string `v2`.

We can reference this variable as follows (let's use `any` for now):

```ts
export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: any): Response {
    return new Response(`The version of the API is ${env.API_VERSION}`);
  },
};
```

## Without Type Safety
You can wrongly assume that `API_VERSION` is a number, so anything stops you from doing arythmethic with it:

```ts
export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: any): Response {
    return new Response(`The previous version of the API is ${env.API_VERSION - 1}`);
  },
};
```

However, the output of the previous code is wrong:

> The version of the API is NaN

## Defining Our Environment Type

To avoid this issue, let's define a custom TypeScript type:

```ts
type EnvType = {
  API_VERSION: string;
};
```

Then we can set this type to the `env` parameter:

```ts
export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: EnvType): Response {
    return new Response(`The previous version of the API is ${env.API_VERSION - 1}`);
  },
};
```

Now we get a TypeScript error:

> [tsserver 2362] [E] The left-hand side of an arithmetic operation must be of type 'any', 'number', 'bigint' or an enum type.

This is our full working code:

```ts
type EnvType = {
  API_VERSION: string;
};

export default {
  fetch(request: Request, env: EnvType): Response {
    return new Response(`The version of the API is ${env.API_VERSION}`);
  },
};
```

As you can see, we just use plain TypeScript to get type safety for our workers.
