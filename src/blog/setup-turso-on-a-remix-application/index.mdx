In a few words, [Turso](https://turso.tech/) is SQLite at the edge. It provides low latency and the free plan is very generous.

The integration of Turso with [Remix](https://remix.run/) is seamless, so this whole tutorial should take you between 5 and 10 minutes and you'll end up with a production ready database, so let's go for it!

## Setup Turso

### Install Turso CLI

Install the Turso CLI either with brew or curl as shown below.

```sh
# brew
brew install tursodatabase/tap/turso

# curl
curl -sSfL https://get.tur.so/install.sh | bash
```

### Sign Up / Log In

Next, create an account or login to it if you already have one:

```sh
# Sign up
turso auth signup

# Log in
turso auth login
```

This will open a browser window to continue the process in Turso's website.

### Create a Database

Let's create a database called `remix-test` by running `turso db create`, which takes around 10 seconds to finish.

```sh
turso db create remix-test
```

Next, ask for the URL string by running `turso db show`.

```sh
turso db show remix-test

# Name:           remix-test
# URL:            libsql://remix-test-giovannibenussi.turso.io
# ID:             f55f93b3-4816-11ee-ad50-1a39a03d9c0e
# Locations:      scl
# Size:           20 kB

# Database Instances:
# NAME                  TYPE        LOCATION
# loving-marionette     primary     scl
```

Remember the value for the *URL* field because we need it for later (in this case, it is *libsql://remix-test-giovannibenussi.turso.io*)

Next, you need to get an authentication token for your database:

```sh
turso db tokens create remix-test
// xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Add the database url generated previoudly and generated token we just generated and provide them as parameters to the `createClient` function:

```js
const client = createClient({
  url: "libsql://your-connection-string.turso.io",
  authToken: "your-auth-token"
});
```

Ideally, you should provide those parameters as environment variables (for example, as `TURSO_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`) so you don't leak them to your shared repository.


### Setup Test Data

Let's connect to your database by running the command below:

```sh
turso db shell remix-test

# Connected to remix-test at https://remix-test-giovannibenussi.turso.io

# Welcome to Turso SQL shell!

# Type ".quit" to exit the shell and ".help" to list all available commands.

# â†’
```

Type the following SQL code to *create* a users table.

```sql
create table users (
  email text unique not null
);
```

Then, run the following code to insert our first user:

```sql
insert into users values ('giovanni.benussi@usach.cl');
```

Now, let's go to setup our application to interact with this database.

## Setup Application
### Install dependencies

Install the [`@libsql/client`](https://github.com/libsql/libsql-client-ts) library:

npm;
```sh
npm install @libsql/client
```

yarn:
```sh
yarn add @libsql/client
```

### Query Data

Define a loader to query all users using SQL:

```jsx
export async function loader() {
  try {
    const rs = await client.execute("select * from users");
    const users = rs.rows;
    return { success: true, users };
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    return { success: false, users: [] };
  }
}
```

Load and display the data in our component:

```js
export default function Index() {
  const { users } = useLoaderData();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.email}>{user.email}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

That's it. With a few lines of code we get our data from a Edge Database with very low latency!

### Insert Data

Add a `Form` to our component to allow to type an email:

```js
<Form method="POST">
  <input name="email" />
</Form>
```

And finally, add an action that handles the form submission.

```js
export const action = async ({ request }) => {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const email = formData.get("email");

  try {
    await client.execute({
      sql: "insert into users values (:email)",
      args: { email },
    });
    return { success: true };
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    return { success: false };
  }
};
```

The code above does retrieves the email from form data using `formData` and runs the corresponding SQL code to insert the new email into the users table.

## Full Source Code

Here's the full source code that we wrote in this article.

You can use it as a template and copy-paste it to get started quickly.

```js
import { Form, useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";
import { createClient } from "@libsql/client";

const client = createClient({
  url: "libsql://your-database.turso.io",
  authToken: "your-auth-token"
});

export async function loader() {
  try {
    const rs = await client.execute("select * from users");
    const users = rs.rows;
    return { success: true, users };
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    return { success: false, users: [] };
  }
}

export const action = async ({ request }) => {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  const email = formData.get("email");

  try {
    await client.execute({
      sql: "insert into users values (:email)",
      args: { email },
    });
    return { success: true };
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
    return { success: false };
  }
};

export default function Index() {
  const { users } = useLoaderData();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.email}>{user.email}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <Form method="POST">
        <input name="email" />
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## TypeScript Support


To add TypeScript support, you need to add a [type assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions) to transform the result from the database to a custom `UserType` array:

```ts
type UserType = {
  email: string;
};

const users = rs.rows as unknown as Array<UserType>;
```

The `as unknown as` part is called [double assertion](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/type-system/type-assertion#double-assertion) and we need it to make our code work, otherwise you'll get an error because the type of `rs.rows`(`Row[]`) can't be converted to `UserType[]` directly because they don't have any data that overlaps. To solve this, we can convert the result to `unknown` first (because `unknown` is compatible with all types) and then convert it `UserType`. You can read more about that approach in this [SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69399211/typescript-why-does-as-unknown-as-x-work).

## Conclusion

In just a few minutes, and with a few lines of code, we created a production ready database and integrated it with out Remix application.

You can improve this code by adding validation (e.g: by using [Zod](https://zod.dev/)) before persisting data. Also, if you want, you can switch to a ORM like [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/docs/installation-and-db-connection/sqlite/turso).
